# Mutational_order_cancer_hallmarks_primary_metastasis
This code shows how to order the hallmarks of cancer in normal (GTEx), primary(TCGA, PCAWG), metastatic (Hartwig) tissues. 
The data used is public for TCGA (for pancancer) and GTEx (normal tissues). You can find the data used on https://zenodo.org/records/10805608.

For each dataset, the analysis is organised in the following order:

-Pancancer order of the hallmarks

-Per cancer types heatmap of the hallmarks

-Per patient frequency of hallmark ranks

-Per patient heatmap of ranks

-dN/dS of hallmarks in pancancer

Hope this helps!
