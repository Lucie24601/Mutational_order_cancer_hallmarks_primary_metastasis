# Mutational_order_cancer_hallmarks_primary_metastasis
This code shows how to order the hallmarks of cancer in normal (GTEx), primary(TCGA, PCAWG), metastatic (Hartwig) tissues. 

For each dataset, the analysis is organised in the following scales:
-Pancancer order of the hallmarks
-Per cancer types heatmap of the hallmarks
-Per patient frequency of hallmark ranks
-Per patient heatmap of ranks
-dN/dS of hallmarks in pancancer

Hope this helps!
